# Meeting Notes 20th October

- Discussion with TA Nihal
  - Midterms on November 6th. Syllabus includes Farley till Chapter 10 (Special emphasis on 9,10). Convert code snippets from one language to another. Format - In person, written, for 3 hours.
  - Office Hours - Fridays 3-4 PM. Hybrid. Recommended attending as it marks checkpoints for evaluation and helps course correct project.
  - Add Prof and TA to GitHub org. (owned by @Rohan Mishra)
  - Suggestion - Avoid using any JavaScript frameworks (especially React) as Prof doesn’t like them and it will trivialise implementation.
- We decided to just go with Vanilla JS for implementation + Jest for testing.
- WorkStream 2's Definition of Done - Hello World project where user can input something and it shows on a Div on clicking a button. Unit Tests + CI + Readme with setup instructions
- P0 Vision - User should be able to add Funds. User should be able to add transactions. User should be able to see the funds and their balances. User should be able to see list of transactions.
- P0 Roadmap - Bare bones implementation within 2 weeks. All of us will assign label P0 to the tasks in GitHub project board.
- UX Plotting - @Rohan Mishra to share screenshots for “inspiration”
- TODO - Clarify what the “weird parts of JS” task is.
